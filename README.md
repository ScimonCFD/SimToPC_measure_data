# SimToPC example data

This repository contains precomputed LPBF single-track simulation results used
in the SimToPC tutorials.

The datasets are provided to enable execution of the `measure` and `surrogate`
modes without running computationally expensive simulations.

During development, the structure and contents of this dataset may change.
A stable archived version of the data will be made available upon publication.
